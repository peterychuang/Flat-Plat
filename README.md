## Flat-Plat-Blue Theme

Flat-Plat-Blue Theme is a GNOME Shell/GTK Theme forked from [Materia Theme (formerly Flat-Plat)](https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/) with the following refinements:

* All coloured elements (e.g. check boxes, sliders, switches, etc) are changed into blue to provide a more consistent and comfortable visual experience;
* The top bar is transparent when no window is maximised (starting from GNOME Shell 3.26, but disabled in GNOME Shell 3.32 due to upstream changes);
* Open Sans is the default font of the theme; and
* Other minor changes and fixes.

The latest version features the redesign of running-app indicators for dash and dash-to-dock (See Screenshot).

The theme includes three variants:

* **Dark** title bar and **light** window's background (Flat-Plat-Blue)
* **Light** title bar and **light** window's background (Flat-Plat-Blue-Light)
* **Dark** title bar and **dark** window's background (Flat-Plat-Blue-Dark)

Each variant comes with **normal** and **compact** themes for different screen sizes.

### The Origin Story

I forked and modified the [Flat-Plat Theme](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat) for personal use, but I reckoned there were people out there who wanted a [colour scheme that was more comfortable to look at](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/issues/19), so I put together the theme and release it. You are welcomed to fork it and make further modifications yourself.
